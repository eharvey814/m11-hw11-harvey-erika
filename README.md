CSS Frameworks and Javascript Assignment

What I used:
1. Navbar: I used the Bootstrap navbar at the top. On small screens it turns into a menu button that opens and closes.
2. Hero Section: A big welcome area with a heading, text, and a button.
3. Grid System: Used for responsive layout in About, Hobbies, and Career Goals sections so they look neat.
4. Cards; Used in About and Hobbies sections to highlight content.
5. Buttons: Bootstrap buttons with minor custom styling (Purple-Learn More, View My Portfolio, Close)
6. Modal: I added the pop‑up window that shows when you click "View My Portfolio"
7. Footer: I added a footer with my name and year.
8. Spacing: I used simple Bootstrap spacing like `mt-5`, `mb-4`, `py-5` to add space.

Custom CSS

-Hero section background color
-Custom button colors and hover effects
